Project Abstract:
The Student Financial Planning and Goal Tracker System is a comprehensive Java-based application aimed at helping students manage their finances efficiently. 
The system allows users to track daily expenses, categorize spending, and set personalized monthly budgets. Beyond simple expense tracking, 
it enables students to set and monitor financial goals such as saving for books, gadgets, or other personal needs, 
providing a clear roadmap to achieve these targets within a specified timeline.

It also features a savings calculator that guides users on how much to save monthly to meet their goals. 
By combining expense management with goal-oriented financial planning, this system promotes responsible money management 
and helps students make informed decisions about their finances, encouraging long-term savings and improved financial literacy.
